  CVS revision numbers.

- Just bringing the packaging and tests up to modern standards. I
  don't really think any sane person should use this module.

- Initial release.  This seems to work but is considered quite alpha.
  Hopefully, people will start using it and I can improve it based on
  user feedback.
