This module allows you to do strange things with $SIG{__DIE__} and
$SIG{__WARN__}.  It scares me.  But it has the potential to be useful
and some people think this just can't be done so this is here to prove
that indeed, it can be done.

Basically, it lets you make these signal handlers scoped to a
particular package.  Even better, the included
Sig::PackageScoped::Paranoid can catch any attempts to globally set
one of these handles and _force_ it to be package scoped, which can be
useful.
