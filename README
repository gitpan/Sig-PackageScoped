NAME
    Sig::PackageScoped - Make $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} package
    scoped

SYNOPSIS
      use Sig::PackageScoped qw(set_sig unset_sig);

      set_sig( __DIE__ => sub { die "Really dead: @_" } );

      unset_sig( __DIE__ => 1 );

DESCRIPTION
    If all your modules use this module's functions to declare their signal
    handlers, then they won't overwrite each other. If you're working with
    modules that don't play nice, see Sig::PackageScoped::Paranoid. But
    really, this is more of a demonstration of weird things you can do with
    Perl than a good thing to use in production. You have been warned.

EXPORTS
    This module will optionally export the "set_sig" and <unset_sig>
    subroutines. By default, nothing is exported.

FUNCTIONS
    This module provides the following functions:

  set_sig()
    This function accepts a hash of options. The keys can be either
    "__DIE__" or "__WARN__", and the values should be coderefs to handle the
    specified pseudo-signal.

  unset_sig()
    This function also expects a hash. The keys should be the pseudo-signal
    to unset, and the value can be any true value.
